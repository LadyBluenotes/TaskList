## General Info

With the knowledge gained within my coding journey thus far, I decided to combine all the information I've acquired into a simple project to best showcase it. Simple HTML was utilized to create the content and allow for user inputs and interactions. 

With the CSS, I attempted my first utilization of Frameworks. Rather than using the popular options such as Bootstrap or Tailwind, I used [Open Props](https://open-props.style/). In addition to Open Props, I used [Glassmorphism CSS Generator](https://ui.glass/generator/) to create the look I was going for.

As for the JavaScript, I adapted the video from (this youtuber)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykuD2QOZkhc] to and added a few of my own touches to it to have the desired effect.

## Technologies

Project was created using HTML5, CSS3, and ES13.
